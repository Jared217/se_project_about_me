### Overview

- Intro

**Intro**

This was the very first project in the TripleTen Software Engineer bootcamp program. Using a provided brief, I created a simple "About Me" landing page

**Concepts**

This project displays entry level HTML structuring and CSS styling

**Deployment**

This project is hosted on Github pages at this [link](https://jared217.github.io/se_project_about_me/)

**Updates**

After completing Sprint 3, I have edited this project to have a responsive design through media queries, for better compatibility across screen sizes. I have also opted to use grid rather than flexbox in the content area for better control of layout at specific sceen sizes.
