            I come from a family with a History of Military Service. I spent a
            little over 6 years in the Infantry, creating some of the best and
            worst experiences of my life, and will always cherish the
            relationships I forged with my squad members.

            I have always held a connection to the ocean. When I was young, we
            lived on the island of Guam because my dad was stationed at Anderson
            AFB there. In my own adult life I had the opportunity to be
            stationed in Hawaii for three years. I love the crashing waves, the
            vibrant colors, and the melodic peace you feel as you listen to
            nature's music.

          <p class="card_description">
            Dogs bring joy to every moment in Life. Throughout my life I have
            had the opportunity to call several dogs my best friend. This is
            Tanner, my childhood dog and my first furry friend. He had the
            kindest sould and the warmest heart. We would take him to the coast
            of Oregon to place called Pacific City, where he would run along the
            beach, climb the sand dunes, and the cold wind of the Pacific
            Northwest would ruffle that beautiful collie coat of his.

            My family has always been big on getting outside and enjoying the
            outdoors. I love hiking. Setting my sights on a peak, outlook, or
            other hiking destination always fills me with immense satisfaction.
            I relate my new career goals to this. There is a mountain of
            information I need to learn and master to become a software
            engineer, and one step at a time I'm going to get to the top.
